# The OpenGeo Suite Experience
This document summarizes each of the group members' OpenGeo Suite experience in the process of developing the app.

Setting up the SDK with the provided Suite documentation is possible, but only if the whole documentation is read very thoroughly. The `suite-sdk` command should really be available without the need to extend the `PATH` environment variable.

I look forward to the Suite SDK containing templates for ol3. Without that, setting up the SDK to allow for ol3 apps adds a bit of overhead.

Thanks to the insights from Paul's censusmap tutorial, we were able to make heavy use of parametrized PostGIS views in GeoServer.
